Preface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After sourching on internet for, and not finding, an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

open book
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that comprises a collection of the many features, resources, configurations
 and applications possible and existant on Linux, I resolved to write this
 book.
 (If you know one, please, tell-me.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intent is not treat the subjects in a very much detailed manner, but
 treat them with some basic concepts and give the essencials for realizing
 a basic task about that subject -- which includes functional key-examples.
 Addionaly, internet and book references will be listed for those who wants
 to deepen its knowlegde about some subject.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another intent is that the structure of this book be of easy consulting
 and with easy readability.
 In other words, as it be a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quick reference manual
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, for each of the subjects covered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, it is expected that the public for this work be, at a first moment,
 from newbie to intermediate on Linux matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Co-authors and contributers for writing sections will be very wellcome.
 Futhermore, because of this, I prefered write the text in English instead
 of my mother language, the Portuguese.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the same way, ortographic and syntactic revisions and corrections would
 be wellcome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, I would like to emphasize that this work is published according
 the GNU FDL (GNU Free Documentation License) and actually hosted on Google

\begin_layout Standard
Depois de procurar na

, e não encontrar, por um 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

livro aberto
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 que cobrisse uma coleção das muitas características, recursos, configurações
 e aplicações possíveis e existentes no Linux, resolvi escrever este livro.
 (Se você souber de um, por favor, diga-me.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A intenção não é tratar de temas de forma muito detalhada, mas tratá-los
 segundo alguns conceitos básicos e dar as essências para se realizar uma
 tarefa básica a respeito de tal assunto -- o que inclui exemplos-chave
 funcionais.
 Adicionalmente, referências na 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

internet
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 e de livros serão listadas para aqueles que quiserem aprofundar seu conheciment
o a respeito de algum assunto.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Outra intenção é que a estrutura deste livro seja de fácil consulta e de
 fácil leitura.
 Em outras palavras, é como se ele fosse um 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assim, espera-se que o público para este trabalho, num primeiro momento,
 estenda-se desde novatos a intermediários quanto aos assuntos Linux.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Co-autores e contribuidores para escrever seções serão muito bem-vindos.
 Ainda, por causa disto, preferi escrever o texto em inglês, ao invés de
 escrevê-lo na minha língua mãe, o português.

Runtime Error While Looking for a Shared Library
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After installing a package with shared libraries, if an error message comes
 on saying that a library could not be found, even it was correctly installed,
 the problem may consist within path references.
 For example, the shared libraries could be installed on 
\family typewriter
/usr/local/lib 
\family default
and the loader could search they on 
\family typewriter
/usr/lib64
\family default
.
 In this case, a solution, that normally works well, is to do symlinks for
 the libraries in 
\family typewriter
/usr/local/lib
\family default
 on 
\family typewriter
/usr/lib64
\family default
.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 <http://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
 copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Preamble
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
 and other kinds of works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
 take away your freedom to share and change the works.
 By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your
 freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it
 remains free software for all its users.
 We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for
 most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way
 by its authors.
 You can apply it to your programs, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
 freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you
 wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that
 you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and
 that you know you can do these things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
 rights or asking you to surrender the rights.
 Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of
 the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom
 of others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
 you received.
 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)
 assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving
 you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that
 there is no warranty for this free software.
 For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions
 be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously
 to authors of previous versions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
 versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do
 so.
 This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom
 to change the software.
 The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
 individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
 Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice
 for those products.
 If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to
 extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as
 needed to protect the freedom of users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software
 on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the
 special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
 proprietary.
 To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render
 the program non-free.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
 follow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
0.
 Definitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
 Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in
 a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
 copy.
 The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or
 a work "based on" the earlier work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
 the Program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
 would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable
 copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private
 copy.
 Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),
 making available to the public, and in some countries other activities
 as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties
 to make or receive copies.
 Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer
 of a copy, is not conveying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
 extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that
 (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that
 there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
 are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and
 how to view a copy of this License.
 If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
 menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Source Code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
 modifications to it.
 "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard
 defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified
 for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers
 working in that language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than
 the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging
 a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b)
 serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to
 implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available
 to the public in source code form.
 A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if
 any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the
 work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
 source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run
 the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
 activities.
 However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose
 tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in
 performing those activities but which are not part of the work.
 For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associate
d with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries
 and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed
 to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between
 those subprograms and other parts of the work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
 automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Basic Permissions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
 on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are
 met.
 This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified
 Program.
 The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only
 if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.
 This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent,
 as provided by copyright law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
 conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
 You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them
 make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities
 for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this
 License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
 Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively
 on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
 them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their
 relationship with you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions
 stated below.
 Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
 under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the
 WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting
 or restricting circumvention of such measures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumventio
n of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected
 by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work,
 and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the
 work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties'
 legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Conveying Verbatim Copies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
 it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
 on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating
 that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section
 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;
 and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
 you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 Conveying Modified Source Versions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce
 it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section
 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and
 giving a relevant date.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under
 this License and any conditions added under section 7.
 This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact
 all notices".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone
 who comes into possession of a copy.
 This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless
 of how they are packaged.
 This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way,
 but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate
 Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that
 do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them
 do so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
 which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which
 are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume
 of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilatio
n and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal
 rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
 Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License
 to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 Conveying Non-Source Forms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections
 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding
 Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including
 a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source
 fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including
 a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid
 for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts
 or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses
 the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
 software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
 medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than
 your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,
 or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at
 no charge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
 offer to provide the Corresponding Source.
 This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
 only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
 subsection 6b.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis
 or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source
 in the same way through the same place at no further charge.
 You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along
 with the object code.
 If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding
 Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
 that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
 directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding
 Source.
 Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated
 to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requireme
nts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
 inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the
 work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection
 6d.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from
 the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying
 the object code work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible
 personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household
 purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.
 In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases
 shall be resolved in favor of coverage.
 For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used"
 refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless
 of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular
 user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.
 A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substanti
al commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
 the only significant mode of use of the product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
 authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
 modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified
 version of its Corresponding Source.
 The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of
 the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely
 because modification has been made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specificall
y for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction
 in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred
 to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the
 transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under
 this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.
 But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
 retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product
 (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requireme
nt to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work
 that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product
 in which it has been modified or installed.
 Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially
 and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules
 and protocols for communication across the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
 accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented
 (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form),
 and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 Additional Terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License
 by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
 Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
 be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
 that they are valid under applicable law.
 If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part
 may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program
 remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove
 any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.
 (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in
 certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions
 on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can
 give appropriate copyright permission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add
 to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
 material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
 of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
 attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed
 by works containing it; or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring
 that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as
 different from the original version; or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors
 of the material; or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,
 trademarks, or service marks; or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
 anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual
 assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
 contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions"
 within the meaning of section 10.
 If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice
 stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a
 further restriction, you may remove that term.
 If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing
 or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material
 governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further
 restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
 place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms
 that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable
 terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form
 of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirement
s apply either way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
8.
 Termination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
 under this License.
 Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically
 terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses
 granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from
 a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and
 until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license,
 and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the
 violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
 permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
 reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation
 of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure
 the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
 of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.
 If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you
 do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section
 10.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
9.
 Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
 copy of the Program.
 Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence
 of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not
 require acceptance.
 However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate
 or modify any covered work.
 These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.
 Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
 acceptance of this License to do so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
10.
 Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives
 a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that
 work, subject to this License.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
 this License.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization
, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or
 merging organizations.
 If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each
 party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives
 whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
 could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of
 the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,
 if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
 granted or affirmed under this License.
 For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge
 for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
 litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
 that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering
 for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
11.
 Patents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License
 of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
 The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
 controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
 that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,
 using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that
 would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
 contributor version.
 For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
 patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
 License.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
 license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use,
 sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the
 contents of its contributor version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement
 or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an
 express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent
 infringement).
 To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement
 or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and
 the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy,
 free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly
 available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must
 either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange
 to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
 work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
 License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.
 "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent
 license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's
 use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable
 patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
 you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
 grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work
 authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of
 the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended
 to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope
 of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exerci
se of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this
 License.
 You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement
 with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under
 which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity
 of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of
 the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
 patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed
 by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
 connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered
 work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license
 was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
 implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
 available to you under applicable patent law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
12.
 No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise
) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you
 from the conditions of this License.
 If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
 obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then
 as a consequence you may not convey it at all.
 For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty
 for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only
 way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain
 entirely from conveying the Program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
13.
 Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission
 to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version
 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work,
 and to convey the resulting work.
 The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
 covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public
 License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply
 to the combination as such.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
14.
 Revised Versions of this License.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 the GNU General Public License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
 may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.
 If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
 Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option
 of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
 of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
 If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public
 License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
 Foundation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
 the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement
 of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version
 for the Program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
 However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
 holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
15.
 Disclaimer of Warranty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW.
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
 PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
 EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
 OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
 YOU.
 SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
 SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
16.
 Limitation of Liability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
 ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
 PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
 GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
 USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
 OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
 THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
 EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
 OF SUCH DAMAGES.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
17.
 Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
 cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
 courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
 waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
 warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
 return for a fee.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
 use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
 which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.
 It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivel
y state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright
 (C) <year> <name of author>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it
 under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
 Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option)
 any later version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
 ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
 FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 See the GNU General Public License for more details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
 with this program.
 If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice
 like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program comes with
 ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
 This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
 conditions; type `show c' for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
 parts of the General Public License.
 Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface,
 you would use an "about box".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
 if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
 For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL,
 see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
 into proprietary programs.
 If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful
 to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.
 If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License
 instead of this License.
 But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

 PREAMBLE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional
 and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
 the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying
 it, either commercially or noncommercially.
 Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
 to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
 modifications made by others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works
 of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
 It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
 designed for free software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software,
 because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come
 with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does.
 But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for
 any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published
 as a printed book.
 We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction
 or reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains
 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under
 the terms of this License.
 Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
 to use that work under the conditions stated herein.
 The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.
 Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".
 You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
 way requiring permission under copyright law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
 or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
 translated into another language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
 Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers
 or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
 matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
 subject.
 (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary
 Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter
 of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
 legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
 designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
 that the Document is released under this License.
 If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is
 not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
 The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.
 If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are
 none.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
 Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
 Document is released under this License.
 A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be
 at most 25 words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented
 in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that
 is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text
 editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
 drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for
 input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
 suitable for input to text formatters.
 A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence
 of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification
 by readers is not Transparent.
 An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of
 text.
 A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
 without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using
 a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript
 or PDF designed for human modification.
 Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
 Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited
 only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
 processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
 HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes
 only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
 such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
 License requires to appear in the title page.
 For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page"
 means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
 preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the
 Document to the public.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title
 either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
 translates XYZ in another language.
 (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowle
dgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the
 Title" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains
 a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states
 that this License applies to the Document.
 These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
 this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication
 that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
 meaning of this License.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 VERBATIM COPYING
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
 or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices,
 and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are
 reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever
 to those of this License.
 You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or
 further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
 However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.
 If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
 the conditions in section 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
 may publicly display copies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 COPYING IN QUANTITY
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
 covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license
 notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that
 carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on
 the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.
 Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher
 of these copies.
 The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
 equally prominent and visible.
 You may add other material on the covers in addition.
 Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
 title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
 copying in other respects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
 you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
 actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
 than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
 with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network
 location from which the general network-using public has access to download
 using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of
 the Document, free of added material.
 If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when
 you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
 Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until
 at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly
 or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document
 well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance
 to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 MODIFICATIONS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
 conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
 Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling
 the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification
 of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
 In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A.
 Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
 that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should,
 if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document).
 You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher
 of that version gives permission.
 B.
 List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible
 for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with
 at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
 authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this
 requirement.
 C.
 State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,
 as the publisher.
 D.
 Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
 E.
 Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to
 the other copyright notices.
 F.
 Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
 the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
 License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
 G.
 Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
 required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
 H.
 Include an unaltered copy of this License.
 I.
 Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to
 it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher
 of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
 If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
 the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its
 Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated
 in the previous sentence.
 J.
 Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
 access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
 locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
 These may be placed in the "History" section.
 You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least
 four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of
 the version it refers to gives permission.
 K.
 For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve
 the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance
 and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
 given therein.
 L.
 Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
 text and in their titles.
 Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
 titles.
 M.
 Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".
 Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
 N.
 Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to
 conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
 O.
 Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
 that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from
 the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections
 as invariant.
 To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
 Version's license notice.
 These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
 but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
 statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization
 as the authoritative definition of a standard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage
 of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover
 Texts in the Modified Version.
 Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
 added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.
 If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously
 added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
 behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on
 explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
 permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorseme
nt of any Modified Version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 COMBINING DOCUMENTS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License,
 under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided
 that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all
 of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections
 of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
 their Warranty Disclaimers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
 identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.
 If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different
 contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end
 of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of
 that section if known, or else a unique number.
 Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant
 Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in
 the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History";
 likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections
 Entitled "Dedications".
 You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
 released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
 License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
 the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
 verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
 it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
 License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
 respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
 independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
 medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilatio
n is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond
 what the individual works permit.
 When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply
 to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative
 works of the Document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
 of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
 aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket
 the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers
 if the Document is in electronic form.
 Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
8.
 TRANSLATION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
 translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
 Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission
 from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some
 or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
 Invariant Sections.
 You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices
 in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
 the original English version of this License and the original versions
 of those notices and disclaimers.
 In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version
 of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
 or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section
 1) will typically require changing the actual title.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
9.
 TERMINATION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
 as expressly provided under this License.
 Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is
 void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from
 a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and
 until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license,
 and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the
 violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
 permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
 reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation
 of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure
 the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
 of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.
 If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt
 of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights
 to use it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
10.
 FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
 Free Documentation License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
 may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
 If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
 "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following
 the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later
 version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundatio
n.
 If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you
 may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
 Foundation.
 If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
 of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance
 of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
 Document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
11.
 RELICENSING
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any World
 Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent
 facilities for anybody to edit those works.
 A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
 A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
 means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license
 published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation
 with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well
 as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part,
 as part of another Document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this License,
 and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere
 other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part
 into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were
 thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under
 CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the
 MMC is eligible for relicensing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
 License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices
 just after the title page:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.
 Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under
 the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later
 version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections,
 no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
 A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentati
on License".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
 replace the "with...Texts." line with this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover
 Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination
 of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
 releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software
 license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in
 free software.
