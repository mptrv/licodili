After sourching on internet for, and not finding, an “open book” that comprises a collection of the many features, resources, configurations and applications possible and existant on Linux, I resolved to write this book. (If you know one, please, tell-me.)

The intent is not treat the subjects in a very much detailed manner, but treat them with some basic concepts and give the essencials for realizing a basic task about that subject -- which includes functional key-examples. Addionaly, internet and book references will be listed for those who wants to deepen its knowlegde about some subject.

Another intent is that the structure of this book be of easy consulting and with easy readability. In other words, as it be a “quick reference manual”, for each of the subjects covered.

Thus, it is expected that the public for this work be, at a first moment, from newbie to intermediate on Linux matter.

Co-authors and contributers for writing sections will be very wellcome. Futhermore, because of this, I prefered write the text in English instead of my mother language, the Portuguese.

On the same way, ortographic and syntactic revisions and corrections would be wellcome.

Finally, I would like to emphasize that this work is published according the GNU FDL (GNU Free Documentation License) and actually hosted on Google Code with the project name 'licodili'. A pdf version is also available for download at Google Code.
